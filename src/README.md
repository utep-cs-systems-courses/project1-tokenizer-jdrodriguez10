Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Project Description: 

For project one we were tasked with creating a tokenizer that also keeps it's
history. We have a tokenizer class that takes a string from a user and
tokenizes it. The history class is used to store that to keep track of all the
users inputs.

# Compile and Run:

In the src folder of the project type "make" and a executable called
tokenizer will be created.

Run the program by typing "./tokenizer"

After using the program you can then use "make clean"  to remove the .o files
from the src folder

# Inputs and Outputs:

The user has four diffrent options to choose from:

1. 'q' to quit the program and the memory will be freed.

2. 's' they input a scentance that will be tokenized and printed back to them
word by word.

3. '!' followed by the number of the id in the history they want.

4. 'h' prints all  history.
